/**
 * The MapSet1 class demonstrates the use of ConcurrentHashMap for managing
 * concurrent operations in a multi-threaded context. It features producers
 * that populate the map and set concurrently and a consumer that performs
 * aggregation and search operations on these structures.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * - ConcurrentHashMap is used to ensure thread safety during concurrent modifications.
 * - Producer threads populate the map and set with key-value pairs.
 * - The consumer thread performs a reduce operation on the map and searches a key in the set.
 *
 * Expected Behavior:
 * - The map's values are summed up, and the result is printed.
 * - The search operation in the set looks for a specific key and prints the result.
