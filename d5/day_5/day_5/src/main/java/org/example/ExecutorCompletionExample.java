/**
 * Demonstrates the use of ExecutorCompletionService for managing asynchronous tasks.
 * This class creates a fixed thread pool and submits a number of tasks to it.
 * Each task sleeps for a random duration to simulate variable task execution times.
 * ExecutorCompletionService is used to efficiently process the results of these tasks
 * as they complete. The main method calculates the sum of the results of all tasks.
